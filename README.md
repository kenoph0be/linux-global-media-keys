LINUX GLOBAL MEDIA PLAYER SHORTCUTS
===================================

These scripts let you media keys work with multiple media players.

Never let your media keys be mapped to a single media player :)

Tutorial (KDE4)
---------------

- Copy the *.sh files to some folder
- Open System Settings => Shortcuts
- Configure a new custom shortcut for each media key and set it to execute the corresponding sh file
- Enjoy :)
