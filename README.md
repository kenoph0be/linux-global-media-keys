Linux Global Media Player Shortcuts
===================================

These scripts let your media keys work with multiple media players.

No more media keys mapped to a single media player, yay :)

Tutorial (KDE4)
---------------

- Copy the *.sh files to some folder
- Open System Settings => Shortcuts
- Configure a new custom shortcut for each media key and set it to execute the corresponding sh file
- Enjoy :)
